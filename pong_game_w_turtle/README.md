# Pong Game

## Description

Pong is a classic arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The objective is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game continues until one player reaches a set number of points, typically 7.

This project implements a simple version of the Pong game using Python and the Turtle graphics library.
