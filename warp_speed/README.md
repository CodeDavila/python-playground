# Warp Speed Simulation

This project is a simulation of warp speed based on the [Coding Train's Starfield Challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/1-starfield). It utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Pygame for playing background music.

## Challenge Description
The challenge is inspired by the Coding Train's Starfield Coding Challenge, where stars move across the screen at varying speeds to create a simulated warp effect.

## Features
- **Animation**: Stars move across the screen at varying speeds, simulating motion through space.
- **Speed Control**: Users can adjust the speed of the animation using a slider, which affects the rate at which stars move.
- **Captain Kirk Interaction**: Captain Kirk's image appears on the screen along with messages depending on the speed selected.
- **Background Music**: The simulation is accompanied by background music from the Star Trek series.

## Setup
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install pygame
    pip install tk

    ```
3. Clone the project repository or download the source code files.
4. Run the main Python script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Controls
- **Speed Slider**: Adjust the speed of the animation by moving the slider vertically.
- **Captain's Message**: Captain Kirk's messages change based on the selected speed.

## Credits
- **The Coding Train**: Inspiration for the Starfield Challenge and the project's core concept.
- **Tkinter**: GUI library for Python.
- **Pygame**: Library for multimedia applications, used for background music.
- **Star Trek**: Inspiration for the theme and characters used in the simulation.
