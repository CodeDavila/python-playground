# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Automatic Breaks**: Automatically switch between work sessions and breaks according to the Pomodoro Technique.
- **Checkmarks**: Keep track of completed work sessions with checkmarks.
- **Reset Option**: Reset the timer and checkmarks at any time.
- **Minimalistic UI**: Clean and simple user interface with a tomato image representing the timer.

## How to Use

1. **Start Timer**: Click on the "Start" button to begin the timer. The timer will automatically switch between work sessions and breaks.
2. **Track Progress**: As each work session completes, a checkmark will be added to indicate completion.
3. **Reset Timer**: Click on the "Reset" button to reset the timer and checkmarks.
