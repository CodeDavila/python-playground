# U.S. States Game

This Python project is a simple game where users can guess the names of U.S. states based on a displayed map. It utilizes the Turtle module for graphics and the pandas library for data manipulation.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `main.py`.
2. A window will open displaying a map of the United States with all state names hidden.
3. Enter the name of a U.S. state when prompted.
4. If the guessed state is correct, its name will be displayed on the map.
5. Continue guessing until you've guessed all 50 states or choose to exit the game.
6. When you exit the game, a file named `missed_states.csv` will be generated containing the names of the states you missed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in Python standard library)
- pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Files

- `main.py`: The main Python script for the game.
- `blank_states_img.gif`: Image file of the U.S. map.
- `50_states.csv`: CSV file containing the names and coordinates of U.S. states.
- `missed_states.csv`: Output CSV file containing the names of missed states.
